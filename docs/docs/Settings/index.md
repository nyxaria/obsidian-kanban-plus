### New line trigger

By default, `enter` creates a new card, and `shift + enter` creates a new line within a card. This can be changed so that `enter` creates new lines and `shift + enter` creates new cards.

### Prepend / append new cards

This setting changes where new cards are inserted into a list, and also where the `Add a card` button is placed. New cards are appended to the list by default.

### Note folder

When [Creating new notes from Kanban cards](../How%20to/Creating%20new%20notes%20from%20Kanban%20cards.md), the `Note template` setting determines the folder in which new notes are created.

### Note template

When [Creating new notes from Kanban cards](../How%20to/Creating%20new%20notes%20from%20Kanban%20cards.md), new notes will be pre-populated with the specified note template.

Supported template formats:

* [Obsidian Templates](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates)
* [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/)

#### Example

With the Obsidian core template plugin active (`Settings > Core plugins > Templates`) create a new note called `Demo Template` in your vault containing:

````
# {{title}}

This file was created on {{date}} {{time}}.
````

Then select the template in your Kanban board's settings:
