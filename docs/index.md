## Settings

### New line trigger

By default, `enter` creates a new card, and `shift + enter` creates a new line within a card. This can be changed so that `enter` creates new lines and `shift + enter` creates new cards.


### Prepend / append new cards

This setting changes where new cards are inserted into a list, and also where the `Add a card` button is placed. New cards are appended to the list by default.
